# 2019 OSU USLI Rover Teensy Controller

In order to run this code, you must install arduino along with teensyduino in order to support flashing to a teensy 3.6 micro controller.

Specific libraries must be downloaded as will be prompted when trying to flash the code such as:

teensythreads.h
Regexp.h
XBee.h
SD.h
SPI.h
Wire.h

These will allow full functionality of the rover teensy code.
